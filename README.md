This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Generate auth secret 

### For npm

```sh
    npm exec auth secret
```
OR
```sh
    npx auth secret
```

### Using the openssl command available on Linux and Mac OS X:

```sh
    openssl rand -base64 33
```

These methods will generate a random string that you can use as your AUTH_SECRET. Make sure to set this in your environment variables:

For example, add it to your .env local file:

```sh
AUTH_SECRET="your_generated_secret"
```
